# znap to do tonight 

* Just a little bit of work, not too much!
* Commoditize it:
    * (/)Change repo name to znap
    * (/)Make snap a git submodule
    * (/)put my example project into git.
    * Is there any way I can easily integrate with the online snap?

    * Can I speed it up by not using the glide-to block, but using
      JS directly?







* It is much slower than it should be -- should compare the actual finish time
  with what it should be.



## Fix the model

* Make the current "zoom" function more generic: transform.




* The "draw line" block should work with our without a zb context.
