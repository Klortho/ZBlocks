# znap to do tonight 

* Just a little bit of work, not too much!
* Commoditize it:
    * (/)Change repo name to znap
    * (/)Make snap a git submodule
    * put my example project into git.
    * Is there any way I can easily integrate with the online snap?

* Fix the model:
    * Make the current "zoom" function more generic: transform.
    * The "draw line" block should work with our without a zb context.
