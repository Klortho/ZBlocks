* Make the matrix-jig into a mockup of what you want to test
    * animate a rectangle going through various transformations
    * Could I combine the matrix-jig and the mocha test?

* Finish the test for animation-context

* Get the old spiral working again, at last
    * use the custom "line-to" block from before


* Then, maybe (if time) see if you can:
    * Hook in to existing move blocks
