# Get to a stopping point

* Organize the good stuff you have, all on one project: znap
    * glide in direction




* Update the README


* Then show the folks on the forum.
* Get existing tests working
    * npm test
    * matrix jig
* Write new tests for existing stuff that works (if there is any)

* Merge AnimationContext and matrix-jig.js
    * Write some new tests for that.

# Where next?

* It would not be easy to hook into the existing blocks -- so
  that means I need new blocks.
